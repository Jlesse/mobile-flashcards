# Mobile Flashcards
This is a react native mobile app that allows a user to create flash cards and practice flash card quizzes. If the user does not complete a quiz everyday, they will get a local notification at 8pm to remind them to complete a quiz. The app uses local  async storage to store the decks and cards. A lot of the styling was done with native base. This app has been tested on the xcode ios simuator iphone 5 and iphone 5 device with expo.
